Pykoda
######

The ``pykoda`` library is an interface to the KoDa API
with a collection of utilities for analysis and machine learning applications.

Its main utility is handling the downloading, parsing, and caching of historical data.

What does it contain?
---------------------
Currently, we are providing information about schedule, vehicle positions, and real time information about delays, service interruptions, etc.
We are following the GTFS standard.
KoDa depends on the transportation authorities to provide the data; some provide only part of the information.

The best way to understand how to use this library is to peruse the ``experiments`` folder,
where we have written examples on different tasks, from machine learning to data visualisation.
